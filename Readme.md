Project Overview

Pawcare on Wheels is an innovative mobile pet-care startup designed for Tier-1 Indian cities (Bangalore, Hyderabad). This project provides a strategic framework to solve the "Logistic Tax" through AI-driven Cluster Optimization and Geospatial Dynamic Pricing.

By leveraging a hybrid model of premium grooming and professional veterinary care, Pawcare transforms a traditionally fragmented service into a high-density, high-margin wellness engine.

Key Features

Integrated Wellness Model: Uses grooming as a "Trojan Horse" to drive high-value medical conversions.

Geospatial Optimization: Implements the "20/2 Rule" (20 clients per 2km radius) to maximize Revenue per Van-Hour (RVH).

Digital Health Twin: A data-driven approach to pet health monitoring and customer retention.

Interactive Dashboard: A strategic validation tool built with Streamlit to compare fragmented vs. optimized business models.
